# Loan Granting Problem

### Objective
In this project, we have a loan dataset from a bank. The data contain all the loans asked to the bank, whether the bank decided to grant it, whether the borrower managed to repay it, and the information about the borrower at the moment 
he/she is asking for the loan. The goal is to build a model to predict whether a customer will repay, which can be 
used to decide whether to grant loans to future customers.


### Results

Feature engineering, exploratory data analysis and visualization, as well as two solutions using a logistic regression and a random forest classifier are shown in [loan_eda_modeling.ipynb](loan_eda_modeling.ipynb)
