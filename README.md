# Loan Granting Problem

### Objective
In this project, we have a loan dataset from a bank. The data contain all the loans requested, whether the bank decided to 
grant it, whether the borrower managed to repay it, and the information about the borrower at the moment he/she is asking for 
the loan. The goal is to build a model to predict whether a customer will repay, which can be used to decide whether to 
grant loans to future customers.


### Results

Feature engineering, exploratory data analysis and visualization, as well as two solutions using a logistic regression 
and a random forest classifier are shown in [loan_eda_modeling.ipynb](loan_eda_modeling.ipynb). Based on the methods 
developed in [loan_eda_modeling.ipynb](loan_eda_modeling.ipynb), a pipeline using object-oriented programming is 
implemented in [loan_oop.ipynb](loan_oop.ipynb).
